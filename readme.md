# Electronic_Chess_Board
With Camille Guyonnaud, we had made an Electronic Chess Board.
The project can be splitted following the next lines:

```
1-Board modelisation (SolidWorks);
2-Leds_Strip connected with some Hall effect sensors (arduino)
```

Indeed, when the player picks up a piece, the board recognises which piece it is and lights up the LEDs of the boxes on which the player can place the piece.

This project is still in progress...
