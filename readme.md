# Electronic_Chess_Board
With Camille Guyonnaud, we had make an Electronic Chess Board.
The project is in different steps: 
  1-Board modelisation (SolidWorks);
  2-Leds_Strip connected with some Hall effect sensor (arduino);
Indeed, when the player picks up a piece, the board recognises which piece it is and lights up the LEDs of the boxes on which the player can place the piece.
